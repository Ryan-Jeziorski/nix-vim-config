Portable Nix-Vim based neovim config

## Thanks To NixVim and MikaelFangel
- A special thanks to NixCommunity and [NixVim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) for the framework
    that makes this project possible.
- Another special thanks to MikaelFangel, while I didn't use his template, I used his nixvim-config as
    a reference for various pieces.
